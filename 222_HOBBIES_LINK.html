        <h6>	When she does have spare time, Soshie enjoys reading and swimming. Both hobbies are mess free and relaxing for her. Additionally, after perfecting the ability to tune out all distractions while reading, both of her hobbies are distraction-free. Swimming is an easy way to get active while doing something that she enjoys. 
        While not a hobby, Soshie does enjoy doing charity work. She runs a local organization for needy brides and cooks dinner for families with sick family members. Just showing people that you care, is enough to make their whole day. This is one lesson Soshie tries to give over to her children through example. She hopes that they will learn to do good things for others without expecting anything in return. </h6>
