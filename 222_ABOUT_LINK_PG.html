    <!--About page content-->
    <div class="about_page_text">
        <p>Soshie Gopin is a mom of six children. While that alone is a full-time job, she is also a purchasing coordinator for a school furniture production company. She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business and marketing.  Though she is busy, Soshie works hard to balance work/life commitments. However, Soshie believes, that being able to let go of perfectionism and understanding that you can’t be everywhere at once is a very important mindset to have. In her spare time, Soshie enjoys reading and swimming laps, to help her relax and carve out some time for herself. 
        Soshie is a “glass half full” kind of person and always tries to have a positive mindset, especially when around her children. Soshie does volunteer work, such as running a local organization for needy brides and cooking for families in difficult situations when possible, to teach her children by example to do good things for others. 
        Soshie says that out of all her various jobs, being a parent is the hardest one. However, seeing her children grow into good people is the best feeling in the world. When her children do the right thing and make good choices, she can take pride in it, unlike any other job. This coincides with her goals in life. When asked Soshie said, “my most important goal is to raise my children to be honest, empathetic, contributing members of society”, and that she inherited this goal from her parents and grandparents, who have taught her about honesty, leadership, courage, and generosity.
